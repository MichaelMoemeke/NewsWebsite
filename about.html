    With different information constantly being spread, it can 
    be difficult to follow what is truly going on in the world.      We seek to provide our users with a website affording 
    general news stories, organized into specific categories 
    such as politics, conflicts, and updates regarding the           ongoing pandemic. The website pulls articles and stories     
    from already existing and reputable news sources, curating 
    an environment of information from multiple perspectives and 
    viewpoints. 
    We provide summaries of multiple articles and stories 
    covering the same subject. In doing this, people can gather 
    information from the top, most trustworthy news sources, and 
    come to their own conclusions based on what they have read.
